    "then note that we are going to minimize $\\mathcal{G}$ which is merely an integral over a quadratic function according to the measure $\\mu$, regularized by negative entropy. We want to find the measure that minimizes this value. In our case specifically, this minimization amounts to minimizing the KL divergence, i.e., $\\mathcal{G}(\\mu)$ is the KL divergence between $\\mu$ and $\\mu_*$ where $\\mu_*$ is standard Gaussian distribution. The idea is that we want to iteratively update the measure $\\mu_n$ according to the proximal-gradient update scheme\n",

    "where $m$ represents the mean and $\\Sigma$ represents the variance (covariance matrix specifically of the iterative distribution). We may use this update structure directly on the mean and variance since every iterative distributional update $\\mu_n$ is Gaussian necessarily and because we have a closed form for the $\\mathrm{JKO}$ operator. So, in our example, we resort to 1D optimal transport through these iterative updates (which we may perform specifically on just the mean and variance through these updates), we have $m_* = 0$ and $\\sigma_* = 1$, and initialize with $m_0 = 10$ and $\\sigma_0 = 100$. At every step, we also have a closed form expression for the Wasserstein-2 distance $W^2 (\\mu_n, \\mu_*) = m_{n}^2 + (1 - \\sqrt{\\sigma_n})^2$. We now code all of this up."
